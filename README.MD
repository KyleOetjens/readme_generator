# README Generation

## Description  

I have created a README generator that will ask the user questions to help build their README file for projects.  I used node to help with this.  The user is prompted to answer quesstions using inquirer.  After they answer all their questions, a README is generated for them to use on their project.  If the user has a license for their project.  It will be added to the README file as well as a  badge for the license.
